    <p>
        I see myself as a “serial startuper”. Since I made of my passion in programing a job, I've always worked for
        start-ups. This allowed me to take profit of my technical versatility.
    </p>
    <p>
        My interests in lots of domains as drawing, reading, photography, science and so is a strong pillar for all my
        work. I take benefits from that knowledge to extend my creativity.
    </p>
    <p>
        To me development – for web or heavy applications – is a matter of creativity. Every need can have multiple
        answers. I guess that the best is the one that allows to keep a maximum versatility and adaptation.
    </p>
    <p>
        For that creativity and knowledge is the key. They allow me to provide innovative solutions to fit that credo.

                    The first product will be the smartest scubadiving computer ever made. With in mind three
                    goals :

                <h4><em>04/2014 to 01/2017</em> <strong>CTO - Associate</strong> @ Enjoy Your Business & EnjoyUp.io</h4>
                <p>
                    I joined Enjoy Your Business as it started as a single developer. Soon we hired
                    a talented designer. We developed the first version of the application that meant to be "like
                    minority report" with the words of the founder.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today I'm the technical lead and referent and an associate of the company. We are a team of a dozen
                    people counting five developers and a designer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Enjoy Your Business is an application witch could be described in one sentence as "productivity
                    through communication and fun". We want to provide a new type of interface to allow the
                    collaborators of a team or company to pilot their projects, communicate and manage their strategy
                    with agility and fun.

                <h4><em>10/2010 to 11/2013</em> <strong>Lead Developer</strong> @ Evaneos</h4>
                <p>
                    I was the first dev hired by Evaneos. Back then we were located in the incubator of the Central
                    Paris School.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I left, after moving location five times, we were about twenty people with developers,
                    marketers production managers and so. And Evaneos had just raised investment for the second time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My personal situation was evolving and I needed to turn my attention to my family. It was time for
                    me to leave Paris again and get time for them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Evaneos is a platform that allows people to buy a trip personally crafted with a local agent from
                    the country you want to leave for.

                <h4><em>07/2009 to 01/2014</em> <strong>Web developement</strong> @ Self-Entrepreneur</h4>
                <p>
                    At that time, I wanted to be more than a developer. I also had my own idea about development that
                    did not fit with my previous experiance. So I decided to become a freelance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Initially I wanted to develop web applications and develop a consulting and formation activity. I
                    left Paris.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I established in Nevers witch is a small city with a very low activity. I encountered
                    difficulties to find customers and to have them understand that developing a web application was
                    worth "a little bit" more than 200.00€ (not kidding so much).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The good point is that a took time to develop my own framework and libraries, witch even though not
                    used by anybody else than me gave me the opportunity to expand my knowledge about object oriented
                    programming. Thanks to that I learnt and experimented PHP, C++, Ruby and lots of other stuff. I also
                    learnt to say "No" when a project is not well defined and the contract ot conditions not fair.

                    I had the opportunity to work on various projects with various technologies. After my formation I

                    I entered the company as a training during my formation. I spent three months in their office based
                    in a five stars hotel. Quite a pleasant place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had for mission to migrate a database from MS Access to SQL Server. It was rude but I learnt a lot
                    on those tools and on database. Most of all I learnt that the choice of a tool or a technology is
                    not only a matter of hype, but a combination of cost and scale.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was working for reporting branch of the company. At the end of the training I was offered to join
                    the company. I declined as I had to get my degree.

                    Programming was my first choice of formation back in High School. I made the mistake to listen
                    people saying that IT had no future. I was young and it was 1998 and the start of the Internet

                    After my technical degree, i realised that I would never have opportunity to be anything else than a
                    technician. I made decision to follow my studies. After a long thinking I chose to enter a
                    management school in Clermont-Ferrand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I stopped after the first year. I realized that that kind of formation was not for me. Most of
                    people I met did not think as I did. In retrospection I think I was laking maturity and was a bit
                    too dreamy. But I keep thinking that even though idealistic my opinions were not wrong. They were
                    just not yet mature.

                <p>
                    Most of my learning their was about me. Even though I discovered management and marketing.

                    That formation was really interesting and gave me some knowledge I would miss today. I learnt the
